  <ul>
    <li><strong>Feb 24, 1955</strong> - Steve Jobs is born to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali in San Francisco. He was soon given up for adoption, making Clara and Paul Jobs his adoptive parents.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan 1, 1970</strong> - This is the year when Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak. They instantly became great friends, even though there was a four-year age gap. </li>
  <li><strong>Apr 1, 1976</strong> - Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne co-found Apple Computer Inc. The company "had a record-setting public stock offering" in 1981 and made the Fortune 500 list in 1983.</li>
